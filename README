A multiplayer terminal version of the old game "snake". Currently only
singeplayer functions properly. Multiplayer has the beginnings of what would
be necessary to function. This project took more time than expected, and college
has soaked up more of it recently, leaving this project sitting in a temporarily
unfinished state.

I am sure that many aspects could have been written more quickly if it wasn't my
first time dealing with networking in C. A tip some people suggest on the web
is using #pragma pack on network structures then changing their byte order to
networking and finally sending casting them to char*. A non-networking version
of each struct is also necessary if decent performance (and proper aliasing
rules) are desired.
